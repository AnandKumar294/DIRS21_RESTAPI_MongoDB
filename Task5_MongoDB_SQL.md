Benefits of MongoDB:

1.  MongoDB is a document store database in NoSQL(Schema less) where the
    data is stored in the form of distributed file system. Each data is
    stored in more than one node for the purpose of fault tolerance and
    data rendunancy.
2.  MongoDB has a better scalability due to horizontal scaling.
3.  There are no complex joins in MongoDB when compared to MS-SQL.

Disadvantages of MongoDB:

1.  As there is a difference between the number of fields, content and
    size of the document stored from one to other, creating a data model
    would be time consuming process that we need to check all the
    documents to collect the data fields used in each document.
