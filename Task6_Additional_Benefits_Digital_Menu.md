Introduction:

Digital menus are clear on what they state and allow the customers to
make efficient use of the spaces. As it is the first point of contact
for a cusomter,it needs to make an impression. 86% of customers get
confused what to order inside restaurant due to lack of information
available in the menu. Nowadays, a digital menu is gradually becoming a
regular trend in the restaurant community.

Additional Benefits on Digital Menu:

1.  The digital menu should have the ability to grab the user's
    attention with videos and animations. Like sharing the day's
    specials or showing pictures of happy customers in a video format.

2.  Editable authorization should be given to the customers to edit
    their menu with no cost.Like the restaurant managers can update
    their prices instantly which boost the sales and profit margins.

3.  A digital menu should use the dayparting program. Thus it
    automatically modifies and updates the dishes according to the
    breakfast, lunch and dinner. So customers will only get a variety of
    dishes that are available at the particular time.

4.  Customers should be able to filter their dishes according to the
    category(Breakfast, lunch, dinner,,etc.,), Time
    available(Break-fast, lunch, etc.,), Availability of
    dishes(Available or sold out) and so on.

Implemented API:

Currently, the REST API which I implemented will serve all the available
dishes to the customer. Additionally, I have also implemented the
additional feature like customer can filter their dishes according to
the category(Breakfast, lunch, dinner,,etc.,), Time
available(Break-fast, lunch, etc.,), Availability of dishes(Available or
sold out).
